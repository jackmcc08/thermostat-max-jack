## Thermostat - Logic Challenge
- [x] Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- [x] You can increase the temperature with an up function
- [x] You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- [x] The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- [x] If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- [x] If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- [x] Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
- [x] You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- [x] You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- [ ] (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

## Thermostat - Interface Challenge

- [x] Decide what HTML elements you will need to serve as controls on the thermostat.  Decide what HTML elements you will need to display the thermostat data.
- [x] Build a static HTML page with these elements, labelling them with appropriate classes and/or IDs.
- [x] You don't need to hook up your thermostat model to the user interface.  That comes in the next challenge!
- [x] Add a `script` tag to load your thermostat JavaScript file into the page.
- [x] Open the developer console and check you can instantiate a thermostat object and call methods on it.
